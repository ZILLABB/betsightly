## Technical Stack

### Frontend

- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite as build tool
- Lucide React for icons
- React Router for navigation

### Backend (Planned)

- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI framework
- MongoDB for database
- Pandas/NumPy for data processing
- SciPy for statistical models

## Project Priorities

1. **Backend Integration**: Connecting the existing frontend to a Python backend
2. **Prediction Quality**: Implementing high-quality statistical models
3. **Social Media Integration**: Automating collection of punter predictions
4. **Admin Interface**: Creating tools for managing predictions and content
5. **Scaling & Performance**: Optimizing for larger user base

## Notes and Considerations

- The frontend is currently using mock data; transitioning to real data from the backend is a priority
- Initial focus should be on prediction quality rather than user accounts
- Cost-effective implementation is important, utilizing free tiers where possible
- The system should be designed to scale gradually as user base grows
